# Cryptocurrencies
## Analysis Overview
The goal of this project is to utilize unsupervised machine learning to evaluate a cryptocurrency database and provide a report that categorizes traded cryptocurrencies into groups based on their characteristics.
An investment bank might utilize this categorization report to propose a new bitcoin investment portfolio to its clients.
For the analysis, we employ the following methods:
- Preprocessing the database
- Principal Component Analysis to reduce data dimension
- K-Means to cluster cryptocurrencies
- 2D and 3D scatter plots to visualize classification results

## Results
We now have a total of 532 marketable cryptocurrencies after the preprocessing and cleaning step.
